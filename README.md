Hey there, I'm [Danut Grigore] 👋
About Me
Welcome to my corner of the internet! 🌍 I’m a Junior Web Developer with a knack for turning coffee into code. Currently, I’m diving headfirst into a Full Stack Development diploma at Code Institute, where I’m mastering the art of both frontend and backend sorcery. My true passion? Building complete, functional, and beautifully crafted websites from the ground up—because there’s nothing quite like bringing a whole web project to life!

Feel free to check out my portfolio to see what I’ve been brewing lately!

Skills
HTML: I speak fluent HTML, crafting web pages that are both beautiful and well-structured—like a perfectly brewed cup of coffee ☕.
CSS & Bootstrap: I’ve got the skills to style the web into a responsive, visually stunning masterpiece, with a little help from Bootstrap’s handy components 🎨.
JavaScript & jQuery: Whether it’s adding a bit of interactivity or creating a full-blown web app, I’m here to make your website as dynamic as it gets ⚡.
Python & Django: When it comes to backend development, I’ve got you covered with robust and scalable web solutions using Python and Django 🐍.
Currently Learning
Full Stack Development: As part of my quest at Code Institute, I’m on a mission to conquer both frontend and backend worlds. React, Node.js, and more—I'm all in! 🚀
Collaboration
Looking for a coding buddy? 🎉 I’m eager to team up on JavaScript/React or Python/Django projects—let’s create something awesome and maybe even learn a thing or two along the way. Got a project idea? Shoot it my way; I promise I’m friendly!

Interests
Full Stack Web Development: I’m always on the hunt for the latest trends, best practices, and ways to push the boundaries of what’s possible on the web. If it’s shiny and new, I’m interested! ✨
